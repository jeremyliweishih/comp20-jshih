This repository documents the work that I have done in COMP20 - Web Programming. The assignment that intrigued me the most was the 2048 Game Center where we utilized Node, Express, and MongoDB to create a web application. Although the assignment was not particularly big, it has shown me how full stack development can be used in a non-academic setting, especially with the advent of the MEAN stack. I have grown so far since day 1 of this course; this course has really shown me the real world applications of web and web technology. The two most important things that I have learned in this course was how to effectively utilize resources to solve your problems and how to quickly learn new technologies and to apply them. Due to the open ended nature of many of our assignment, an example of the former would be whenever we were utilizing a new framework, it is important to look for solutions online. An example of the latter would be whenever we had to learn a new framework on our own, like phaser for our group project, we had to quickly assess what this framework would do and how we could effectively apply it. I would love to dive further into full stack web development to create user-friendly interfaces that solve real world problems.
